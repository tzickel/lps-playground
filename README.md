This repository is a playground to test the feasibility of the [launcher plugin specification](https://github.com/tzickel/launcher-plugin-specification). Do not think of it as something more then my playground.

Currently there is a [Python](python) implementation for a simple calculator plugin and a launcher api reference implementation, and a [NodeJS](nodejs) launcher api reference implementation.
